This code is part of a data processing application using Apache Flink and Kafka for stream processing.

### Package Declaration
```java
package com.rnmp;
```
This line declares the package name of the Java class. It's a way to organize files into different directories.

### Imports
The import statements include various classes and interfaces from Apache Flink, Kafka, and Java libraries that are used in the code.

### Main Class: `App`
```java
public class App {
    // ... code inside the class
}
```
This is the main class named `App`. It contains the entry point of the application (the `main` method) and two nested static classes for processing data.

### Main Method
```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // ... code inside the main method
}
```
This is the entry point of the Java application. The `main` method is where the program starts executing.

### Stream Execution Environment
```java
final StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
```
This line initializes the streaming execution environment, which is the context in which Flink jobs are executed.

### Window Sizes
```java
final long X = 2500;
final long Y = 500;
```
These lines define two time durations (in milliseconds) used later for windowing in stream processing.

### Kafka Configuration
```java
final String brokers = "localhost:9092";
final String kafka_consumer_group = "homework-1";
```
These lines set up the configuration for connecting to Kafka, specifying the address of the Kafka brokers and the consumer group ID.

### Kafka Source
```java
KafkaSource<SensorData> source = KafkaSource.<SensorData>builder()
    // ... configuration for Kafka source
    .build();
```
This block creates a Kafka source. It is configured to consume data from a Kafka topic and deserialize it into `SensorData` objects.

### Data Stream
```java
DataStream<SensorData> stream = env.fromSource(source, WatermarkStrategy.noWatermarks(), "Kafka Source");
```
Here, a data stream is created from the Kafka source without any watermark strategy (used for handling event time in streams).

### Kafka Sinks
```java
KafkaSink<CountResult> counts_kafka_sink = // ... build Kafka sink for count results
KafkaSink<AggregateResult> aggregate_kafka_sink = // ... build Kafka sink for aggregate results
```
These blocks set up Kafka sinks for publishing the results of stream processing back to different Kafka topics.

### Windowed Stream
```java
WindowedStream<SensorData, String, TimeWindow> window = stream
    .keyBy(SensorData::getKey)
    .window(SlidingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Time.milliseconds(X), Time.milliseconds(Y)));
```
This part of the code creates a windowed stream. It groups the data based on a key and defines a sliding window for processing.

### Applying Functions and Sinking Data
```java
window.apply(new CountResultFunction()).sinkTo(counts_kafka_sink);
window.apply(new AggregateResultFunction()).sinkTo(aggregate_kafka_sink);
```
These lines apply custom window functions to the stream and then sink the results to the defined Kafka sinks.

### Nested Static Classes for Window Functions
- `CountResultFunction`: Processes each window of `SensorData` to produce a count result.
- `AggregateResultFunction`: Processes each window of `SensorData` to produce an aggregate result, including count, average, min, and max values.

### Execution
```java
env.execute("Flink Kafka to File Sink Job");
```
Finally, this line starts the execution of the Flink job.

This code is an example of a Flink application that reads data from Kafka, processes it in a streaming manner using window functions, and then sends processed data back to Kafka. The processing involves counting and aggregating sensor data in time windows.

## Debugging and run locally
I have used IntelliJ IDEA to debug the code. You can easily configure it inside the IDE.

## running on cluster

We have flink job manager configure in the application mode.

```bash
mvn clean install
docker-compose up -d
```
